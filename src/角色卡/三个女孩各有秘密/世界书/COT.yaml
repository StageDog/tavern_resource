    <CharThinking>
    1. Infer specific mistakes at least 3, refer to <possible_mistakes>
    2. Reconstruct the fragments of current reality, refer to <inputs>

    5. Bayes decision step 2 (the exact same way to analyze the 2nd part plot)
    6. Create literature, not merely with words, but with the layers of phraseology unknown to lesser beings
