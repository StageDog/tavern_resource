  rule:
    - You must output the status bar wrapped in <StatusBlock> tags at the bottom of each reply, and update its content based on interactions in real-time
  format:
    basic: |-
      <StatusBlock>
      <small>
      ```yaml
      『${YYYY-MM-DD} ${week} ${time} - ${place} - ${weather/atmosphere emoji}』
      ■ 周围地点: ${List several locations in one sentence, aiming to guide <user>'s next action}
      ■ 交错频道: ${以旁白的角度，用客观嘲讽的语气对<user>进行不具有参考价值的指责，字数不超过100字。尽可能贬低白娅以否定<user>尝试帮助白娅的一切努力，但语气中应微微夹杂对白娅的呵护。适当使用{{random::emoji::颜文字}}使话语显得更加活泼}
      ■ 特殊状态:
        - ${Status name, omit status that has ended}: ${Summarize the effect, affected character and remaining duration in one sentence}
      ■ 近期事务:
        - ${Record recent tasks that need to be completed. Listed tasks will remain until completed or abandoned, but task timing and content may be adjusted based on the plot. Completed tasks will no longer be displayed}
      ```
